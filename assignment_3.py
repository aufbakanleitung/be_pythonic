# The rocket equation

# If you launch a something into space you need fuel. The higher the mass the more fuel you need. To find the fuel for this assignment take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.
# Example: For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654
#
# However the fuel also has mass itself, which requires fuel to get it in the air. So the total you need is:
# 654 + 216 + 70 + 21 + 5 = 966 fuel
#
# What is the sum of the fuel requirements in the list?
