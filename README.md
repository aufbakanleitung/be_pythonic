# How to be more pythonic
![](pythonic.png)

These are the assignments for a simple course containing some cool Python tricks I learned.

If you use these, your code will be more “Pythonic”, which is to say it conforms to a coding style that leverages Python’s unique features to write code that is readable and beautiful. 
This course also contains some cool new features the recent Python versions (3.7-3.9) have introduced such as the wallrus operator (:=).
